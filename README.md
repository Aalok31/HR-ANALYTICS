## ðŸ§® DAX Measures (selected)
```DAX
Employees = COUNTROWS(Employees)

Attritions =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Employees),
    Employees[Attrition] = "Yes"
)

Attrition Rate % =
DIVIDE([Attritions], [Employees])

Average Age = AVERAGE(Employees[Age])

Average Monthly Income = AVERAGE(Employees[MonthlyIncome])

Average Years at Company = AVERAGE(Employees[YearsAtCompany])

Attritions by Category =
VAR _attr =
    CALCULATE([Attritions], ALLEXCEPT(Employees, Employees[Category]))
RETURN _attr
```

## âœ… Insights & Recommendations
- Focus retention efforts on **Sales** and **R&D**, especially roles: *Sales Executive*, *Lab Technician*, *Research Scientist*.
- Early-career groups (**18â€“35**) and **lower salary bands (â‰¤ 10k)** are high-risk segments.
- **Overtime** and **frequent travel** likely correlate with attritionâ€”consider policies addressing workload and travel.
- Targeted learning paths and career progression can reduce exits in junior roles.
